# Binary decision diagrams
Welcome visitor. This repository contains a C++ library for creating and manipulating Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams. 
Library is still in the developement so everything is quite messy. This is public just because I want to show what it can do so far.

Originally I wrote quite long readme with different examples, but even I have found it complicated...
so I have decided to just show couple of simple examples in ```main.cpp```.  
There is quite a lot of files but all you need is to ```#include "bdd/bdd_tools.hpp"``` and check methods and function declared there. Diagram class itself in ```#include "bdd/bdd.hpp"``` has couple of useful methods too.
