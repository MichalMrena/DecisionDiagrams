# ðŸ§¸ TeDDy

TeDDy is a C++ library for creation and manipulation of decision diagrams. It is being developed as a project at the [Faculty of Management Science and Informatics](https://www.fri.uniza.sk/en/), [University of Å½ilina](https://www.uniza.sk/index.php/en/) at the [Department of Informatics](https://ki.fri.uniza.sk/).

## Decision diagrams
This text assumes that the reader is familiar with decision diagrams to some extent. Our library supports [Binary Decision Diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_decision_diagram) (BDDs) and their generalization Multivalued Decision Diagrams (MDDs).

## How to install
Library is header only so it is easy to incorporate it in your project. All you need to do is to place contents of the [include](./include/) directory in your project files and include a header file in your code as is shown in the [examples](#Examples) below.  
If you would like to use the library in multiple projects and you are a Linux user you can use the following commands to install TeDDy:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:MichalMrena/DecisionDiagrams.git
cd DecisionDiagrams
sudo make install
```
This installs library files to `/usr/local` which should be visible to your compiler. You can specify different path by setting `PREFIX` variable: `sudo make PREFIX=<path> install`.  
To uninstall the library go to the directory where you've run the install command and run `sudo xargs rm < install_manifest.txt`.

### Compiling
TeDDy uses features from `C++20` so you might need to set your compiler for this version of the C++ language by using the `-std=c++20` flag for `clang++` and `g++` and `/std:c++latest` for MSVC. It was tested with `g++ 11.1.0` and `MSVC TODO`.

## Library API
Functions from the library are accesed via instance of a manager. TeDDy offeres four managers for different kinds of decision diagrams.  
`1 bdd_manager` for Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs).  

`2 mdd_manager<P>` for Multivalued Decision Diagrams (MDDs) representing Multiple-Valued logic functions. Variables and functions can have values from the set {0, 1, ... P - 1}.  

`3 imdd_manager` for (integer) Multivalued Decision Diagrams (iMDDs) representing integer functions. Domains of variables are specified in a constructor of the manager and are from the set {0, 1, 2, ...}. Functions can have values from the set {0, 1, 2, ...}.

`4 ifmdd_manager<PMax>` for (integer) Multivalued Decision Diagrams (iMDDs) representing integer functions. Domains of variables are specified in a constructor of the manager and are from the set {0, 1, 2, ...,  PMax - 1}. Functions can have values from the set {0, 1, 2, ...}.  
  
Managers `1`, `2` and `4` use nodes with more compact memory representation since maximum of the domains is known during compile time. The only difference between `3` and `4` is in this property so if `PMax` is known it is better to use manager `4`.

## Examples - basic usage
```C++
#include "teddy/teddy.hpp"
// or use if you've installed the library
// #include <teddy/teddy.hpp>

int main()
{
    // 4 variables, 1000 pre-allocated nodes:
    teddy::bdd_manager manager(4, 1'000);

    // create diagram for a single variable (indices start at 0):
    auto x0 = manager.variable(0);

    // we recommend using auto, but if you want you can use an alias:
    using diagram_t = teddy::bdd_manager::diagram_t;
    diagram_t x1 = manager.variable(1);

    // operator() serves the same purpose as .variables call:
    auto& x = manager;
    diagram_t x2 = x(2);

    // diagrams for multiple variables can be created at once:
    std::vector<diagram_t> xs = manager.variables({0, 1, 2, 3, 4});

    // diagram_t is cheap handle type, multiple diagrams can point
    // to a same node, to test whether they do .equals can be used:
    assert(&x1 != &xs[1] && x1.equals(xs[1]));

    // to create a diagram for more complicated function f:
    //     f(x) = (x0 and x1) or (x2 and x3)
    using namespace teddy::ops; // (to simplify operator names)
    // we use the apply function:
    diagram_t f1 = manager.apply<AND>(xs[0], xs[1]);
    diagram_t f2 = manager.apply<AND>(xs[2], xs[3]);
    diagram_t f  = manager.apply<OR>(f1, f2);

    // now that we have diagram for funtion f, we can test its properties
    // e.g. evaluate it for give variable assignment
    unsigned int val = manager.evaluate(f, std::array {1, 1, 0, 1});
    // val will contain either 0 or 1 (1 in this case)

    // we can see how the diagram looks like by printing its dot representation
    // into a file or console and visualizing it using e.g. graphviz
    manager.to_dot_graph(std::cout, f); // console
    std::ofstream ofst("f.dot");
    manager.to_dot_graph(ofst, f); // file

    // to calculate number of different variable assignments for which the
    // function evaluates to 1 we can use satisfy_count:
    std::size_t sc = manager.satisfy_count(f);

    // we can also enumerate all variable assignments for which the
    // the function evaluates to 1:
    std::vector<std::array<unsigned int, 4>> sa
        = manager.satisfy_all<std::array<unsigned int, 4>>(f);
}
